{"workshopId":1749419330,"Title":"Qud Kissing","Description":"Adds a little bit of romance into the lives of the various inhabitants of Qud.\n\nWhen you talk to a creature there is now a \"Let's Chat\" option which begins some basic conversation for getting to know the person. Your choices in that conversation will subtly affect their disposition towards you. Chatting for a long time or having an unpleasing conversation will exhaust their patience. Patience builds back up over time so if you come back in a few days they might be more interested in talking to you again.\n\nWhen a creature's disposition towards you reaches certain levels it adds options for Giving Gifts, Attempting to Kiss, and Proposing Dates to the options for the Let's Chat dialogues and also to the advanced interaction menu.\n\nIf you propose a date to someone and they agree, then use the interaction menu for another item that isn't too far away to invite them to that object for the date.\n\nDates and gifts are assessed based on the person's interests and hobbies.\n\nIf you attempt to kiss someone they will assess whether they're attracted to you and if they are, they will kiss you back.\n\nYou can see the code, make contributions to the mod, and report issues at: https://github.com/acegiak/qudkissing","Tags":"romance,kissing,npcs,social","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
